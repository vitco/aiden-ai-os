/**
 * core/v4/sandboxFs.ts — v4.4 Phase 2: filesystem allowlist enforcement.
 *
 * Pure in-process path policy decision module. Consulted by the six
 * file_* tools (file_read, file_list, file_write, file_patch,
 * file_copy, file_move, file_delete) BEFORE any disk I/O, so a
 * decision can be returned to the agent without ever touching the
 * filesystem when the answer is "no".
 *
 * Two-list model (mirrors Phase 1's `SandboxConfig`):
 *   - fsDenyList  — sensitive paths the user never wants touched
 *                   (.ssh, .aws, .env, /etc, /var, ...). Wins for
 *                   BOTH read and write operations. Denylist always
 *                   takes precedence over allowlist.
 *   - fsAllowList — write-permitted roots (cwd, ~/Documents,
 *                   ~/Downloads, ~/Desktop, os.tmpdir()). Writes /
 *                   deletes outside these roots are refused. Reads
 *                   are NOT constrained by the allowlist — reads
 *                   only have to clear the denylist.
 *
 * Symlink defense:
 *   - Realpath the target (or its first existing ancestor for
 *     non-existent paths like file_write destinations). Symlink
 *     bypass on allowlist roots is the canonical attack vector;
 *     this module canonicalizes before checking.
 *   - A path that is LEXICALLY under an allowlist root but
 *     REALPATH'd outside (via a symlink) yields a distinct
 *     `fs.symlink_escape` violation code.
 *
 * Non-existent path handling (Q-P2-3 default):
 *   - Walk up to the first existing ancestor, realpath that, then
 *     rejoin the trailing segments. This defends against
 *     `<allowlist-root>/<symlinked-dir>/new-file.txt` writes.
 *
 * TOCTOU posture (Q-P2-5 default):
 *   - Phase 2 is in-process. A racing actor could rename a
 *     directory between our policy check and the tool's open()
 *     call. Phase 3 (Docker sandbox) closes this gap at the OS
 *     layer via container isolation. Phase 2 documents the gap
 *     and accepts it for the strict-opt-in `AIDEN_SANDBOX=1`
 *     period (default-off until Phase 6).
 *
 * Short-circuit semantics:
 *   - When `config.enabled === false` (default through Phase 5),
 *     `isPathAllowed` returns `{ allowed: true, resolvedPath: ...,
 *     ... }` with no denylist/allowlist evaluation. Zero overhead
 *     for users who haven't opted in. Phase 6 flips the gate but
 *     the wire-in stays.
 *
 * The returned `PathPolicyDecision` shape is also forward-compatible
 * with Phase 5's `FailureCategory.sandbox_violation` — the
 * `violation.category` field is pre-populated with the constant
 * Phase 5 will register in FailureClassifier.
