 *  - chat_completions:    OpenAI-style /v1/chat/completions wire format.
 *                         Used by Groq, OpenRouter, Together, Gemini-compat,
 *                         Cerebras, NVIDIA, and any OpenAI-spec endpoint.
 *  - anthropic_messages:  Native Anthropic /v1/messages with tool_use blocks
 *                         and prefix caching. Also used for Claude
 *                         subscription OAuth.
 *  - codex_responses:     OpenAI's /v1/responses stream (Codex). Also used
 *                         for ChatGPT subscription OAuth flows.
 *  - ollama_prompt_tools: Local Ollama fallback. Tools are emulated by
 *                         injecting JSON-call instructions into the prompt
 *                         (no native tool calling).
